# React-To-Do-List
This is a simple react to do list that was created for practicing my react skills. To try it out download the zip, open powershell (or terminal on mac), change the directory to React-To-Do-List/client using the cd command, then run the npm start command. The app should then start on http://localhost:3000. Have fun! :)
